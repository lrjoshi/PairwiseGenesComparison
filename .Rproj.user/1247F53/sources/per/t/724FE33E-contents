\description{
This package can be used to compare indiviual genes of the two genomes. This package makes use of coding sequences format that can be found in Genbank. Right now, the package allows pairwise comparison of the genes of two genomes. You find detail manual in the github wiki section. You will need FASTA Nuceotide sequence files of the two genomes. The can be obtained from the Genbank. If you click on Send to button on Genbank, then you can select "Coding Sequences" and then FASTA Nucleotide or FASTA Protein sequences. Then you can run pairwise_genes_comparison() funtion in R. Once, you run the function it will ask you to upload two files that you want to companre. It will create a nice summary table called "summary_table,csv" in the current folder. It used DECIPHER package for pairwise alignment and to generate similarity matrix.

\arguments{
  You don't need any additional arguments with this function. Just run the function and it will prompt you to upload your files.

\note{
When you upload your files, remember the order. Output tables will have suffixes 1 and 2 based on how the files were uploaded. For example: Start_position1 would refer to the start position of the gene from a file that was uploaded first.
